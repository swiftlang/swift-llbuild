# ``SwiftProtobufPluginLibrary``

A reusable framework for building `protoc` plugins in Swift.

## Overview

The `protoc-gen-swift` program is run by `protoc` to generate Swift code
from the parsed proto data.
This library encapsulates many of the common elements needed to build
such programs.
It's separated out here so that other people can reuse it.
