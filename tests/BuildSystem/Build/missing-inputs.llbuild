# Check reporting of missing inputs (including missing inputs produced by other

# Run an initial build which fails on the command.

# RUN: rm -rf %t.build
# RUN: mkdir -p %t.build
# RUN: cp %s %t.build/build.llbuild
# RUN: %{llbuild} buildsystem build --serial --chdir %t.build &> %t.out || true
# RUN: cat %t.out

#
# CHECK-FAILURE: cannot build 'output-1' due to missing inputs: 'input'
# CHECK-FAILURE-NOT: missing input 'output-2' and no rule to build it

# RUN: touch %t.build/input

# At this point, we have unblocked the commands, and commands are allowed to run
# against missing outputs of previous commands (under the expectation that the
# commands themselves will diagnose errors). This approach allows transparent
# support of commands which may not produce an output (as long as the consumer
# is prepared to handle this), but we could also diagnose missing outputs as a
# response to the producing command to get stronger consistency checking.

# CHECK-FAILURE-2-NOT: missing input 'output-2' and no rule to build it
# CHECK-FAILURE-2: cp: {{.*}}output-2{{.*}}: No such file
